Hi, I’m Vikas M, a Software Developer with over 3 years of experience in building scalable microservices and full-stack applications using Java, Spring Boot, and React.js.

I currently work at Comviva on the MobiLytix Rewards Platform, where I’ve developed key backend services and led the Merchant Portal development. My work involved real-time transaction processing, Kafka-based event flows, Redis caching, and integrating secure authentication using Keycloak.

I’ve also built client-facing dashboards in React and optimized performance across services, reducing response time and infra cost.

I’m now looking for new challenges where I can contribute to high-impact systems and grow as a full-stack engineer.
