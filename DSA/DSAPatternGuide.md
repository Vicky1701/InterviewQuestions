## 7-Day DSA Pattern Mastery Plan
## Weekly DSA Pattern Mastery Plan (Repeat Each Week)

**Learning Order:**
- **Two Pointers** 
- **Sliding Window** 
- **Hashing** (Day 3-4): 
- **Binary Search** 
- **BFS/DFS** 
- **Recursion** 
- **Greedy**

Each day, focus on one pattern and solve 3 LeetCode problems.  
After 7 days, repeat the cycle with new problems for each pattern.

### Day 1 (Thursday): Two Pointers
- [LeetCode #1] Two Sum
- [LeetCode #26] Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
- [LeetCode #283] Move Zeroes
- **Revision:** Review mistakes, summarize key techniques

### Day 2 (Friday): Sliding Window
- [LeetCode #643] Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K
- [LeetCode #3] Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
- [LeetCode #209] Minimum Size Subarray Sum
- **Revision:** Revisit solved problems, note patterns

### Day 3 (Saturday): Hashing
- [LeetCode #1] Two Sum
- [LeetCode #49] Group Anagrams
- [LeetCode #387] First Unique Character in a String
- **Revision:** Flashcards for hashing tricks, review notes

### Day 4 (Sunday): Recursion
- [LeetCode #509] Fibonacci Number
- [LeetCode #46] Permutations
- [LeetCode #78] Subsets
- **Revision:** Write pseudo-code, revisit recursion tree

### Day 5 (Monday): Binary Search
- [LeetCode #33] Search in Rotated Sorted Array
- [LeetCode #153] Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
- [LeetCode #69] Sqrt(x)
- **Revision:** List edge cases, review binary search template

### Day 6 (Tuesday): BFS / DFS
- [LeetCode #200] Number of Islands
- [LeetCode #102] Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
- [LeetCode #733] Flood Fill
- **Revision:** Draw graphs/trees, summarize traversal steps

### Day 7 (Wednesday): Greedy
- [LeetCode #55] Jump Game
- [LeetCode #134] Gas Station
- [LeetCode #455] Assign Cookies
- **Revision:** Review greedy choices, compare with DP

**How to use this plan:**
- After 7 days, repeat the cycle with new problems for each pattern (e.g., pick different LeetCode problems for week 2).
- Continue this for as many weeks as you want—there’s no upper limit!
- This method ensures you cover all patterns multiple times and build strong intuition.

**Why this works:**
- Daily focus on one pattern builds depth.
- Repetition across weeks builds retention and pattern recognition.
- Consistent revision helps you learn from mistakes and reinforce concepts.
