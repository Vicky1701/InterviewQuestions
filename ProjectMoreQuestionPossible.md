Absolutely, Vikas. Based on your MobiLytix Loyalty Platform project, here’s a comprehensive list of possible interview questions, grouped into key categories. These are the questions an interviewer might ask to deep dive into your contribution, technical stack, system design, problem-solving, and architectural understanding.

✅ 1. High-Level Project Understanding
These test your clarity about the project’s purpose and architecture.

What was the core problem the MobiLytix platform aimed to solve?

Who were the primary users or stakeholders of this platform?

Can you explain the overall architecture of the platform?

Why did you use microservices for this solution instead of a monolithic architecture?

How does real-time transaction processing work in your system?

How do the services communicate with each other? (REST, Kafka, gRPC?)

What are the key challenges of building a loyalty platform like this?

✅ 2. Your Role and Contributions
Interviewers will want to know what you specifically did.

Which specific services did you work on, and what were your responsibilities?

Can you explain the Member Service in detail? What data does it handle?

What challenges did you face while building the Merchant Portal?

Did you contribute more to frontend or backend? How did you collaborate across the stack?

How did you handle versioning and updates of microservices?

What was your process for testing and deploying new features?

Were you involved in any critical bug fixes? Can you explain one?

✅ 3. Microservices & Backend Architecture
They will dig deeper into your Spring Boot and microservice experience.

How are services deployed? (Docker, Kubernetes, EC2, etc.)

How do services authenticate/authorize requests? (Did you use Keycloak or OAuth?)

How is data consistency managed across microservices?

How is fault tolerance or circuit breaking handled in your services?

How do you manage distributed transactions?

What kind of database do your services use? (RDBMS? NoSQL?)

How do you handle logging, monitoring, and alerting?

✅ 4. Frontend (React.js) Questions
Since you built the Merchant Portal, expect questions like:

What React libraries or state management solutions did you use?

How did you integrate React with backend microservices?

How did you handle API errors and loading states in the UI?

How did you manage role-based access or permissions on the frontend?

Can you walk me through a specific component you built?

How did you ensure reusability and performance in the React components?

✅ 5. System Design Questions (Project-Based)
These will test your architectural thinking.

Design a simplified version of the Member Service.

How would you scale the Wallet Service to handle millions of transactions?

What are the key considerations when designing a catalog service for rewards?

How would you implement retries and failure handling for redemption workflows?

How do you design APIs to ensure backward compatibility?

How would you handle race conditions when redeeming points in real time?

✅ 6. Performance, Scalability & Security
Enterprise systems demand scale and robustness.

How did you ensure the platform scales with growing users and partners?

What security measures did you implement in the platform?

Did you perform load testing? What tools were used?

Were there any rate-limiting or throttling mechanisms?

How do you secure inter-service communication?

✅ 7. CI/CD, DevOps & Deployment
Since you worked on releases and environments:

What was your CI/CD pipeline like?

Which tools did you use for deployments? (Jenkins, GitLab CI, etc.)

Were you involved in setting up Docker or Kubernetes for services?

How did you manage environment-specific configurations (dev, QA, prod)?

How did you perform rollback in case of failed releases?

✅ 8. Collaboration, Agile & Ownership
Soft skills are often tested through scenario-based questions.

How did you manage collaboration between frontend and backend teams?

How did you plan and prioritize tasks during sprints?

Were you ever in a client call or demo session? What feedback did you handle?

Describe a time when a feature had to be reworked. What did you learn?

✅ 9. Testing & Quality Assurance
You mentioned test cases—expect questions like:

What kind of tests did you write? Unit, integration, E2E?

Which frameworks did you use for backend and frontend testing?

How did you ensure test coverage in your services?

Were there automated tests in the CI pipeline?

✅ 10. Behavioral Questions (Contextualized to Your Project)
They may wrap technical questions in behavioral format.

Tell me about a time you faced a production issue in this project.

Tell me about a conflict in implementation choices with a teammate.

Tell me about a feature you’re proud of from this project.

Describe a time when you made a mistake. How did you recover?

✅ Bonus: Project-Specific Follow-ups
These are tricky, based on what you already said in your summary:

How did the Merchant Portal interact with the analytics system?

Can you explain how the loyalty tiers and point expiration were implemented?

What was the most complex feature you built in the Merchant Portal?

How does the system handle concurrent point redemptions?

Would you like me to:

Prioritize top 20 questions most likely to be asked?

Create sample answers for key technical/HR questions?

Or convert this into a Notion tracker / PDF interview prep sheet?

Let me know how you’d like to proceed next.
