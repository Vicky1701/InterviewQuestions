üîπ Core Java
OOP Concepts (Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism)

Interfaces vs Abstract Classes

String vs StringBuilder vs StringBuffer

Collection Framework: List, Set, Map differences + internal workings

Exception Handling (checked vs unchecked)

Multithreading basics (Runnable, Thread, synchronized)

Java 8 Features:

Stream API (filter, map, reduce, collect)

Optional, Functional Interface, Lambda

üîπ Spring Boot + Hibernate
Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

Annotations: @RestController, @Service, @Autowired, @Transactional

Dependency Injection vs Autowiring

JPA vs Hibernate

One-to-Many and Many-to-One Mappings

Hibernate Caching & Lazy Loading

üîπ SQL Queries (Hands-On)
Write JOIN queries (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)

Aggregate Functions: SUM, COUNT, GROUP BY, HAVING

Subqueries, IN, EXISTS

UPDATE, DELETE with conditions

üîπ React + JavaScript (Essentials)
Functional vs Class Components

Props vs State

Lifecycle methods or useEffect

useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo

Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components

Basic form handling & API calling using fetch or axios

üîπ DSA (Problem Patterns)
Be able to write code without hesitation for:

Array: Two Sum, Kadane's, Max Subarray

String: Reverse, Palindrome, Anagram

HashMap: Frequency Counter, First Non-Repeating

Stack/Queue: Valid Parentheses, Min Stack

Sorting: Bubble, Selection, Quick Sort basics

Recursion: Fibonacci, Factorial

üß™ Step 2: Mandatory Hands-On Practice (Short List)
Pick these 8 things and do small code examples or recall what you've already done.

üîß Topic	üñêÔ∏è What to Practice
Java 8 Streams	Filter list, group by, sort
Java Collections	HashMap, ArrayList, TreeMap usage
Spring Boot	Create a simple @RestController + @Service
Hibernate	Mapping OneToMany with JPA
SQL	Write a JOIN query combining 2+ tables
React	Create a form with useState and onChange
JavaScript	Implement debounce/throttle conceptually
DSA	Write 2 problems fully (Array + HashMap)
