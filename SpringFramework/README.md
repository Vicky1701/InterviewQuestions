  - Dependency Injection
  - Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)
  - Simplified testing
  - Integration with various frameworks
  - Non-invasive framework

**Q2: What is the difference between Spring Framework, Spring, Spring MVC, and Spring Boot?**
- **Spring Framework**: Core framework with IoC, DI, AOP
- **Spring**: Same as Spring Framework
- **Spring MVC**: Web module of Spring for building web applications
- **Spring Boot**: Auto-configuration framework built on top of Spring

## üîÑ Spring IoC & Dependency Injection

### IoC Container

**Q4: What is IoC (Inversion of Control) and DI (Dependency Injection)?**
- **IoC**: Design principle where control of object creation is transferred to external entity
- **DI**: Implementation of IoC where dependencies are injected rather than created

**Q5: What is the role of IoC Container?**
- Creates objects
- Manages object lifecycle
- Injects dependencies
- Provides configuration metadata

**Q6: What are types of IoC containers in Spring?**
- **BeanFactory**: Basic container with lazy initialization
- **ApplicationContext**: Advanced container with eager initialization, event publishing, internationalization

**Q7: What is the difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext?**
| BeanFactory | ApplicationContext |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Lazy initialization | Eager initialization |
| Basic DI support | Advanced features |
| No event publishing | Event publishing |
| Manual registration | Automatic registration |

### Dependency Injection Types

**Q8: What are the types of Dependency Injection?**
- **Constructor Injection**: Dependencies injected through constructor
- **Setter Injection**: Dependencies injected through setter methods
- **Field Injection**: Dependencies injected directly into fields

**Q9: Which is the best way to inject beans and why?**
- **Constructor Injection** is preferred because:
  - Ensures immutability
  - Mandatory dependencies are clear
  - Prevents partial object creation
  - Better for testing

**Q10: What is the difference between Constructor Injection and Setter Injection?**
| Constructor Injection | Setter Injection |
|----------------------|------------------|
| Mandatory dependencies | Optional dependencies |
| Immutable objects | Mutable objects |
| Fails fast | May create partial objects |
| Thread-safe | Not inherently thread-safe |

**Q11: What is circular dependency issue and how to resolve it?**
- **Issue**: When two beans depend on each other
- **Solutions**:
  - Use setter injection instead of constructor injection
  - Use @Lazy annotation
  - Redesign to avoid circular dependency
  - Use @PostConstruct for initialization

```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    @Bean
    public UserService userService() {
        return new UserService();
    }
}
```

### Bean Scopes
