2. Introduction to HashMap and TreeMap
3. Master functional interfaces (Predicate, Function)

### **🤝 Integration Goals for Next Week**:
1. Connect stack pattern to Java Collections Stack

3. Document integration patterns for future reference

### **Habit Adjustments**:
- **Start earlier**: ________________

## 📚 **KNOWLEDGE VAULT**

### **🧠 DSA Solutions to Remember**:
1. **Two Sum HashMap Solution**:
   ```java
   Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
   for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
       int complement = target - nums[i];
       if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
           return new int[]{map.get(complement), i};
       }
       map.put(nums[i], i);
   }
   ```
   **Why it works**: O(1) lookup reduces nested loop O(n²) to single loop O(n)

### **☕ Java Patterns to Remember**:
1. **Lambda for filtering**:
   ```java
   list.stream()
       .filter(x -> x > 0)
       .collect(Collectors.toList());
   ```
   **Why it works**: Functional approach is more readable than traditional loops

### **🤝 Integration Examples**:
1. **Two Sum with Java 8**:
   ```java
   // Traditional DSA approach + Java 8 enhancement
   return IntStream.range(0, nums.length)
       .boxed()
       .collect(/* custom collector for two sum */);
   ```
