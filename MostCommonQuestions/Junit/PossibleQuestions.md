## üöÄ INTERVIEW SURVIVAL TIPS

### If You Don't Know the Exact Answer:
1. **Explain the concept**: "I understand the principle behind this..."
2. **Show willingness**: "I haven't implemented this specifically, but I would approach it by..."
3. **Ask for clarification**: "Are you asking about unit testing or integration testing?"

### Safe Answers to Have Ready:
- "I'm familiar with JUnit concepts and eager to apply them hands-on"
- "I understand testing principles and have been practicing writing basic tests"
- "I know the importance of mocking for isolating dependencies"

### Code Writing Strategy:
- Start with AAA pattern structure
- Use simple, clear variable names
- Explain your approach as you write
- It's okay to say "I'd need to check the exact syntax, but the approach would be..."
