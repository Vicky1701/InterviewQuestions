## üöÄ INTERVIEW SURVIVAL TIPS

### Core Concepts You Must Explain Clearly:
1. **What React is**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
2. **Virtual DOM**: Efficient way to update UI by comparing virtual representations
3. **Components**: Reusable pieces of UI that accept props and return JSX
4. **State vs Props**: Internal data vs external data passed down
5. **Hooks**: Functions that let you use state and lifecycle in functional components

### Safe Answers to Have Ready:
- "React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces with a component-based architecture"
- "I understand React's declarative approach and virtual DOM concepts"
- "I'm comfortable with functional components, hooks, and state management"
- "I know how to handle component lifecycle and optimize performance"

### When Asked About Experience:
- "I have experience building React applications with modern hooks"
- "I understand React fundamentals and have worked with components and state management"
- "I'm familiar with React ecosystem including routing and state management patterns"

### Code Writing Strategy:
- Start with functional component structure
- Use modern hooks (useState, useEffect) instead of class components
- Explain your approach as you write
- Focus on clean, readable code with proper naming

## üìö QUICK REFERENCE - KEY DEFINITIONS

**React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
**JSX**: Syntax extension that allows writing HTML-like code in JavaScript
**Component**: Independent, reusable piece of UI
**Props**: Properties passed to components from parent
**State**: Internal data that determines component's behavior and rendering
**Hook**: Special function that lets you use React features in functional components
**Virtual DOM**: JavaScript representation of the real DOM for efficient updates
**Event Handling**: How React components respond to user interactions

---

## üîë ESSENTIAL CODE PATTERNS TO KNOW

### Basic Functional Component
```jsx
function MyComponent({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}
```

### useState Hook
```jsx
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Count: {count}
    </button>
  );
}
```

### useEffect Hook
```jsx
function DataFetcher() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchData().then(setData);
  }, []); // Empty dependency array = run once on mount
  
  return <div>{data ? data.name : 'Loading...'}</div>;
}
```

### Event Handling
```jsx
function Button() {
  const handleClick = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    console.log('Button clicked!');
  };
  
  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>;
}
```

## üé≤ COMMON REACT PATTERNS TO PRACTICE

### Conditional Rendering
```jsx
{isLoggedIn ? <Dashboard /> : <Login />}
{error && <ErrorMessage />}
```

### List Rendering
```jsx
{items.map(item => (
  <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
))}
```

### Form Handling
```jsx
const [value, setValue] = useState('');
<input 
  value={value} 
  onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)} 
/>
```

## üèóÔ∏è COMPONENT LIFECYCLE MAPPING (Class to Hooks)

| Class Component | Hooks Equivalent |
|----------------|------------------|
| componentDidMount | useEffect(() => {}, []) |
| componentDidUpdate | useEffect(() => {}) |
| componentWillUnmount | useEffect(() => { return () => {} }, []) |
| shouldComponentUpdate | React.memo() |
| getDerivedStateFromProps | useState + useEffect |

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è COMMON INTERVIEW MISTAKES TO AVOID

- Don't mutate state directly - always use setState or state setters
- Remember that useEffect without dependency array runs on every render
- Don't forget keys when rendering lists
- Understand that props are read-only
- Know that useState updates are asynchronous
- Remember that functional components re-run entirely on each render
- Don't confuse controlled vs uncontrolled components
- Understand when to use useCallback vs useMemo
- Know that useEffect cleanup functions prevent memory leaks
