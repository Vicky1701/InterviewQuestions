# Microservices Interview Questions - Complete Study Guide

## ðŸ”¥ MUST-KNOW Questions (High Priority)

### Core Microservices Concepts

**Q1: What are microservices and what problems do they solve?**

**Answer:**
Microservices are an architectural approach where applications are built as a collection of small, independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs.

**Problems they solve:**
- **Scalability**: Scale individual services based on demand
- **Technology diversity**: Use different tech stacks for different services
- **Team independence**: Teams can work independently on different services
- **Fault isolation**: If one service fails, others continue working
- **Deployment flexibility**: Deploy services independently without affecting others

**Simple analogy**: Think of a restaurant - instead of one chef doing everything, you have specialized chefs (pizza chef, salad chef, dessert chef) working independently but coordinating to serve customers.

**Q2: What is the difference between monolithic and microservices architecture?**

**Answer:**

| Aspect | Monolithic | Microservices |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| **Structure** | Single deployable unit | Multiple small services |
| **Database** | Shared database | Database per service |
| **Deployment** | Deploy entire application | Deploy services independently |
| **Scaling** | Scale entire application | Scale individual services |
| **Technology** | Single tech stack | Multiple tech stacks possible |
| **Communication** | In-process calls | Network calls (HTTP/messaging) |

**Example**: 
- **Monolithic**: Like a Swiss Army knife - all tools in one unit
- **Microservices**: Like a toolbox - separate specialized tools that work together

---

**Q3: What are the advantages and disadvantages of microservices?**

**Advantages:**
- **Independent deployment**: Update services without affecting others
- **Technology flexibility**: Choose best technology for each service
- **Better fault isolation**: Service failures don't crash entire system
- **Team autonomy**: Teams can work independently
- **Scalability**: Scale only what you need

**Disadvantages:**
- **Complexity**: More moving parts to manage
- **Network latency**: Services communicate over network
- **Data consistency**: Harder to maintain consistency across services
- **Testing complexity**: Integration testing becomes complex
- **Operational overhead**: More services to monitor and maintain

**Key takeaway**: Microservices are great for large, complex applications with multiple teams, but overkill for simple applications.

---

**Q4: What are the key principles of microservices architecture?**

**Answer:**
1. **Single Responsibility**: Each service should do one thing well
2. **Autonomous**: Services should be independently deployable
3. **Business-focused**: Organized around business capabilities
4. **Decentralized**: No central control, services make own decisions
5. **Failure-resistant**: Design for failure, services should handle failures gracefully
6. **Observable**: Easy to monitor and debug
7. **API-first**: Services communicate through well-defined APIs

**Memory tip**: Think "SABDFOA" - Single responsibility, Autonomous, Business-focused, Decentralized, Failure-resistant, Observable, API-first

---

**Q5: How do microservices communicate with each other?**

**Answer:**

**1. Synchronous Communication:**
- **REST APIs**: HTTP-based, simple and widely used
- **gRPC**: High-performance, binary protocol
- **GraphQL**: Query language for APIs

**2. Asynchronous Communication:**
- **Message queues**: RabbitMQ, Amazon SQS
- **Event streaming**: Apache Kafka, Amazon Kinesis
- **Pub/Sub**: Google Pub/Sub, Redis Pub/Sub

**When to use what:**
- **Synchronous**: When you need immediate response (user login, payment processing)
- **Asynchronous**: For notifications, data synchronization, background processing

---

**Q6: What is service discovery and why is it important?**

**Answer:**
Service discovery is the mechanism by which services find and communicate with each other in a microservices environment.

**Why it's important:**
- Services are dynamic (start/stop/scale)
- IP addresses change frequently
- Manual configuration is not scalable

**Types:**
1. **Client-side discovery**: Client queries service registry (Netflix Eureka)
2. **Server-side discovery**: Load balancer handles discovery (AWS ELB)

**Popular tools:**
- Netflix Eureka
- Consul
- etcd
- Kubernetes service discovery

**Simple example**: Like a phone directory - instead of remembering everyone's number, you look it up when needed.

---

**Q7: What is an API Gateway and its role in microservices?**

**Answer:**
An API Gateway is a single entry point for all client requests to microservices. It acts as a reverse proxy that routes requests to appropriate services.

**Key responsibilities:**
- **Request routing**: Direct requests to correct services
- **Authentication & authorization**: Centralized security
- **Rate limiting**: Control request rates
- **Request/response transformation**: Modify data format
- **Monitoring & analytics**: Track API usage
- **Load balancing**: Distribute requests across service instances

**Benefits:**
- Single entry point for clients
- Reduces client complexity
- Centralized cross-cutting concerns

**Popular API Gateways**: Kong, Netflix Zuul, Amazon API Gateway, Spring Cloud Gateway

---

**Q8: What is distributed transaction and how do you handle it?**

**Answer:**
A distributed transaction spans multiple services/databases and must ensure all operations succeed or all fail together.

**Challenges:**
- Network failures
- Service unavailability
- Partial failures

**Solutions:**

**1. Two-Phase Commit (2PC):**
- Coordinator asks all participants to prepare
- If all agree, coordinator tells all to commit
- **Problem**: Blocking protocol, coordinator is single point of failure

**2. SAGA Pattern:**
- Chain of local transactions
- If one fails, execute compensating actions
- **Types**: Orchestration (central coordinator) vs Choreography (event-driven)

**3. Event Sourcing:**
- Store events instead of current state
- Replay events to get current state

**Best practice**: Avoid distributed transactions when possible. Design services to be eventually consistent.

---

### Communication Patterns

**Q9: What is synchronous vs asynchronous communication in microservices?**

**Answer:**

**Synchronous Communication:**
- Client waits for response
- Direct request-response
- **Examples**: REST API calls, gRPC
- **Use case**: When immediate response needed

```
Client â†’ Service A â†’ Service B â†’ Response back to Client
```

**Asynchronous Communication:**
- Client doesn't wait for response
- Fire-and-forget or eventual response
- **Examples**: Message queues, event streaming
- **Use case**: Background processing, notifications

```
Client â†’ Message Queue â†’ Service A (processes later)
```

**When to use:**
- **Sync**: User authentication, payment processing, data retrieval
- **Async**: Email notifications, data synchronization, report generation

---

**Q10: When would you use REST vs messaging for service communication?**

**Answer:**

**Use REST when:**
- Need immediate response
- Simple request-response pattern
- Query operations (GET data)
- Client needs to know operation result immediately

**Use Messaging when:**
- Fire-and-forget operations
- Bulk data processing
- Event notifications
- Need to decouple services
- Handling high volume of requests

**Example scenario:**
- **REST**: User login (need immediate success/failure response)
- **Messaging**: Send welcome email after user registration (can be processed later)

---

**Q11: What is circuit breaker pattern and why is it needed?**

**Answer:**
Circuit breaker prevents cascading failures by monitoring service calls and "opening" when failure rate exceeds threshold.

**States:**
1. **Closed**: Normal operation, calls go through
2. **Open**: Service is failing, calls are rejected immediately
3. **Half-open**: Testing if service has recovered

**Why needed:**
- Prevent cascading failures
- Fail fast instead of waiting for timeout
- Give failing service time to recover
- Improve user experience

**Implementation:**
- Monitor failure rate and response time
- Open circuit when threshold exceeded
- Periodically test if service recovered
- Close circuit when service is healthy

**Popular libraries**: Netflix Hystrix, Resilience4j

---

**Q12: What is the difference between orchestration and choreography?**

**Answer:**

**Orchestration:**
- **Central coordinator** manages the workflow
- Coordinator tells each service what to do and when
- **Analogy**: Orchestra conductor directing musicians

**Choreography:**
- **No central coordinator**
- Services react to events and know what to do next
- **Analogy**: Dancers following choreography without conductor

**Example - Order Processing:**

**Orchestration:**
```
Order Service â†’ Payment Service
Order Service â†’ Inventory Service  
Order Service â†’ Shipping Service
```

**Choreography:**
```
Order Created Event â†’ Payment Service listens â†’ Payment Processed Event
Payment Processed Event â†’ Inventory Service listens â†’ Inventory Reserved Event
Inventory Reserved Event â†’ Shipping Service listens â†’ Ships Order
```

**When to use:**
- **Orchestration**: Complex workflows, need central control
- **Choreography**: Simple workflows, want loose coupling

### Design Patterns & Best Practices

**Q13: What is Database per Service pattern?**

**Answer:**
Each microservice has its own private database that only it can access directly.

**Benefits:**
- **Data isolation**: Changes to one service's data don't affect others
- **Technology choice**: Each service can choose optimal database
- **Independent scaling**: Scale databases based on service needs
- **Team autonomy**: Teams own their data

**Challenges:**
- **Data consistency**: No ACID transactions across services
- **Data duplication**: Same data might exist in multiple databases
- **Complex queries**: Can't join data across services easily

**Implementation strategies:**
- Use APIs for cross-service data access
- Implement eventual consistency
- Use SAGA pattern for distributed transactions
- Consider CQRS for complex queries

---

**Q14: What is SAGA pattern and when to use it?**

**Answer:**
SAGA is a pattern for managing distributed transactions by breaking them into a series of local transactions, each with a compensating action.

**Types:**

**1. Orchestration SAGA:**
- Central coordinator manages the workflow
- Coordinator decides what happens next
- Easier to monitor and debug

**2. Choreography SAGA:**
- No central coordinator
- Services communicate through events
- More resilient but harder to monitor

**Example - E-commerce Order:**
1. Reserve inventory
2. Process payment
3. Create shipment

**If payment fails:**
1. Compensate: Release inventory reservation

**When to use:**
- Need distributed transactions across services
- Want better availability than 2PC
- Can tolerate eventual consistency

**Tools**: Axon Framework, Eventuate, Camunda

---

**Q15: What is CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)?**

**Answer:**
CQRS separates read and write operations into different models.

**Traditional approach:**
- Same model for reads and writes
- One database for everything

**CQRS approach:**
- **Command side**: Handles writes (Create, Update, Delete)
- **Query side**: Handles reads (SELECT operations)
- Different databases optimized for each operation

**Benefits:**
- **Optimized performance**: Read and write databases optimized separately
- **Scalability**: Scale read and write sides independently
- **Flexibility**: Different technologies for different needs

**When to use:**
- Complex business logic
- High read/write ratio differences
- Need different scalability for reads vs writes
- Complex reporting requirements

**Example:**
- **Write side**: Relational database for transactions
- **Read side**: NoSQL database for fast queries, search engine for full-text search

---

**Q16: What is Event Sourcing pattern?**

**Answer:**
Instead of storing current state, store all events that led to the current state.

**Traditional approach:**
```
User: { id: 1, name: "John", email: "john@email.com", status: "active" }
```

**Event Sourcing approach:**
```
Events:
1. UserCreated: { id: 1, name: "John", email: "john@email.com" }
2. UserActivated: { id: 1 }
3. EmailChanged: { id: 1, newEmail: "john.doe@email.com" }
```

**Benefits:**
- **Complete audit trail**: Know exactly what happened when
- **Time travel**: Recreate state at any point in time
- **Event replay**: Rebuild system from events
- **Debug friendly**: Easy to understand what went wrong

**Challenges:**
- **Storage requirements**: Events accumulate over time
- **Complexity**: More complex than CRUD operations
- **Event versioning**: Handle changes to event structure

**When to use:**
- Need complete audit trail
- Compliance requirements
- Complex business domains
- Need to replay events for analysis

---

**Q17: How do you handle data consistency in microservices?**

**Answer:**
Since microservices use separate databases, traditional ACID transactions don't work across services.

**Strategies:**

**1. Eventual Consistency:**
- Accept that data will be consistent "eventually"
- Use event-driven architecture
- Services publish events when data changes

**2. SAGA Pattern:**
- Coordinate distributed transactions
- Use compensating actions for rollback

**3. Event Sourcing:**
- Store events instead of current state
- Replay events to achieve consistency

**4. CQRS:**
- Separate read and write models
- Synchronize through events

**5. Two-Phase Commit (avoid if possible):**
- Coordinated transaction across services
- Blocks if coordinator fails

**Best practices:**
- Design for eventual consistency
- Use idempotent operations
- Implement retry mechanisms
- Monitor data synchronization

---

**Q18: What is the Strangler Fig pattern?**

**Answer:**
Gradually replace a monolithic application by intercepting requests and redirecting them to new microservices.

**How it works:**
1. **Facade/Proxy**: Intercepts all requests to monolith
2. **Gradual migration**: Route some requests to new microservices
3. **Incremental replacement**: Move functionality piece by piece
4. **Remove monolith**: When all functionality is migrated

**Benefits:**
- **Low risk**: Migrate incrementally
- **No big bang**: Avoid massive rewrites
- **Rollback capability**: Can revert if issues occur
- **Business continuity**: System remains operational during migration

**Implementation steps:**
1. Identify bounded contexts
2. Create API gateway/proxy
3. Build new microservices
4. Route traffic gradually
5. Monitor and validate
6. Remove old functionality

**Named after**: Strangler fig tree that grows around other trees and eventually replaces them.
