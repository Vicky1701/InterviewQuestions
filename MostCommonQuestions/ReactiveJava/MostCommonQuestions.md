## üöÄ INTERVIEW SURVIVAL TIPS

### Core Concepts You Must Explain Clearly:
1. **Reactive Programming**: Asynchronous programming with data streams and event propagation
2. **Non-blocking**: Operations don't block threads while waiting for I/O
3. **Backpressure**: Mechanism to handle slow consumers
4. **Mono vs Flux**: Single value vs stream of values
5. **Publisher-Subscriber**: Core pattern for reactive streams

### Safe Answers to Have Ready:
- "Reactive programming is about building asynchronous, non-blocking applications"
- "I understand the benefits of reactive programming for scalable applications"
- "I'm familiar with Project Reactor and Spring WebFlux concepts"
- "I know how reactive programming helps with resource efficiency"

### When Asked About Experience:
- "I understand reactive programming principles and have studied Project Reactor"
- "I'm familiar with the difference between blocking and non-blocking operations"
- "I know when reactive programming is beneficial and when traditional approaches are better"

### Code Writing Strategy:
- Start with simple Mono/Flux creation
- Use common operators like map, filter, flatMap
- Always remember to subscribe to make streams work
- Explain the non-blocking nature of operations

## üîë ESSENTIAL CODE PATTERNS TO KNOW

### Basic Mono/Flux Creation
```java
// Creating Mono
Mono<String> mono = Mono.just("Hello");
Mono<String> empty = Mono.empty();
Mono<String> error = Mono.error(new Exception("Error"));

// Creating Flux
Flux<Integer> flux = Flux.just(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
Flux<Integer> range = Flux.range(1, 10);
Flux<String> fromList = Flux.fromIterable(Arrays.asList("a", "b", "c"));
```

### Common Operators
```java
// Transformation
Flux<Integer> numbers = Flux.range(1, 5)
    .map(n -> n * 2)                    // Transform each element
    .filter(n -> n > 5)                 // Filter elements
    .doOnNext(System.out::println);     // Side effect

// FlatMap for async operations
Flux<String> result = Flux.just(1, 2, 3)
    .flatMap(n -> callAsyncService(n))  // Flatten async results
    .subscribe();
```

### Error Handling
```java
Flux<String> withErrorHandling = Flux.just("1", "2", "invalid", "4")
    .map(Integer::parseInt)
    .map(n -> "Number: " + n)
    .onErrorContinue((error, item) -> {
        System.err.println("Error processing: " + item);
    });
```

### WebFlux Controller
```java
@RestController
public class ReactiveController {
    
    @GetMapping("/users")
    public Flux<User> getUsers() {
        return userService.findAll();  // Returns Flux<User>
    }
    
    @GetMapping("/users/{id}")
    public Mono<User> getUser(@PathVariable String id) {
        return userService.findById(id);  // Returns Mono<User>
    }
    
    @PostMapping("/users")
    public Mono<User> createUser(@RequestBody Mono<User> userMono) {
        return userMono.flatMap(userService::save);
    }
}
```

### WebClient Usage
```java
WebClient client = WebClient.create("http://api.example.com");

Mono<String> response = client
    .get()
    .uri("/users/{id}", userId)
    .retrieve()
    .bodyToMono(String.class);
```

---

## üé≤ COMMON REACTIVE PATTERNS TO PRACTICE

### Combining Streams
```java
// Zip - combine latest from each stream
Mono<String> combined = Mono.zip(mono1, mono2)
    .map(tuple -> tuple.getT1() + tuple.getT2());

// Merge - merge multiple streams
Flux<String> merged = Flux.merge(flux1, flux2, flux3);
```

### Async Processing
```java
Flux<String> async = Flux.range(1, 10)
    .flatMap(n -> processAsync(n))  // Process each element asynchronously
    .subscribeOn(Schedulers.parallel());  // Use parallel scheduler
```

### Retry Logic
```java
Mono<String> withRetry = webClient
    .get()
    .uri("/api/data")
    .retrieve()
    .bodyToMono(String.class)
    .retry(3)  // Retry up to 3 times
    .timeout(Duration.ofSeconds(5));  // Timeout after 5 seconds
```

## üèóÔ∏è REACTIVE MANIFESTO PRINCIPLES

1. **Responsive**: System responds in a timely manner
2. **Resilient**: System stays responsive in the face of failure
3. **Elastic**: System stays responsive under varying workload
4. **Message-driven**: System relies on asynchronous message-passing

- Don't forget to handle errors properly in reactive streams
- Remember that WebFlux is not always better than Spring MVC
- Understand that reactive programming has a learning curve
- Know that debugging reactive code can be challenging
