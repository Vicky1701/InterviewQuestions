Tell me about your project" â€“ Optimized Answer:

I worked on the MobiLytix Loyalty Platform at Comviva, a microservices-based enterprise solution for managing digital rewards and customer loyalty. It connects key stakeholdersâ€”Club Owners, Sponsors, Reward Partners, and Club Membersâ€”enabling end-to-end loyalty operations like campaign management, rewards redemption, and real-time transaction handling.

The platform comprises around 8 core microservices, including Member Service, Wallet, Loyalty Gateway, Catalogue, Notification, and more. Each handles specific domains like profile management, points tracking, reward catalogs, and customer engagement.

My role evolved over two phases:

ðŸ”¹ Initially, I worked on the Member Service, focusing on user registration, tier tracking, and profile workflows. I also resolved several critical issues around API integration and data consistency, ensuring smooth communication between services like Wallet and Notification.

ðŸ”¹ Later, I led the development of the Merchant Portal, a self-service web app that allows business partners to configure campaigns, track engagement analytics, manage catalogs, and view reports. It tightly integrates with our backend microservices for real-time data updates.

This project strengthened my expertise in Spring Boot, microservice communication, REST APIs, and React.js for enterprise UIs. It also gave me practical exposure to solving scalability and integration challenges in a high-availability, customer-centric platform.
