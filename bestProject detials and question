Tell me about your project" ‚Äì Optimized Answer:

I worked on the MobiLytix Loyalty Platform at Comviva, a microservices-based enterprise solution for managing digital rewards and customer loyalty. It connects key stakeholders‚ÄîClub Owners, Sponsors, Reward Partners, and Club Members‚Äîenabling end-to-end loyalty operations like campaign management, rewards redemption, and real-time transaction handling.

The platform comprises around 8 core microservices, including Member Service, Wallet, Loyalty Gateway, Catalogue, Notification, and more. Each handles specific domains like profile management, points tracking, reward catalogs, and customer engagement.

My role evolved over two phases:

üîπ Initially, I worked on the Member Service, focusing on user registration, tier tracking, and profile workflows. I also resolved several critical issues around API integration and data consistency, ensuring smooth communication between services like Wallet and Notification.

üîπ Later, I led the development of the Merchant Portal, a self-service web app that allows business partners to configure campaigns, track engagement analytics, manage catalogs, and view reports. It tightly integrates with our backend microservices for real-time data updates.

This project strengthened my expertise in Spring Boot, microservice communication, REST APIs, and React.js for enterprise UIs. It also gave me practical exposure to solving scalability and integration challenges in a high-availability, customer-centric platform.

Let me know if you want a version tailored more toward frontend/backend, managerial roles, or focused on interview-specific use cases like behavioral rounds or system design discussions.

Would you like me to prepare follow-up questions and ideal answers too?

Design a simplified version of the Member Service.

How would you scale the Wallet Service to handle millions of transactions?

What are the key considerations when designing a catalog service for rewards?

How would you implement retries and failure handling for redemption workflows?

How do you design APIs to ensure backward compatibility?

How would you handle race conditions when redeeming points in real time?

‚úÖ 6. Performance, Scalability & Security
Enterprise systems demand scale and robustness.

How did you ensure the platform scales with growing users and partners?

What security measures did you implement in the platform?

Did you perform load testing? What tools were used?

Were there any rate-limiting or throttling mechanisms?

How do you secure inter-service communication?

‚úÖ 7. CI/CD, DevOps & Deployment
Since you worked on releases and environments:

What was your CI/CD pipeline like?

Which tools did you use for deployments? (Jenkins, GitLab CI, etc.)

Were you involved in setting up Docker or Kubernetes for services?

How did you manage environment-specific configurations (dev, QA, prod)?

How did you perform rollback in case of failed releases?

‚úÖ 8. Collaboration, Agile & Ownership
Soft skills are often tested through scenario-based questions.

How did you manage collaboration between frontend and backend teams?

How did you plan and prioritize tasks during sprints?

Were you ever in a client call or demo session? What feedback did you handle?

Describe a time when a feature had to be reworked. What did you learn?

‚úÖ 9. Testing & Quality Assurance
You mentioned test cases‚Äîexpect questions like:

What kind of tests did you write? Unit, integration, E2E?

Which frameworks did you use for backend and frontend testing?

How did you ensure test coverage in your services?

Were there automated tests in the CI pipeline?

‚úÖ 10. Behavioral Questions (Contextualized to Your Project)
They may wrap technical questions in behavioral format.

Tell me about a time you faced a production issue in this project.

Tell me about a conflict in implementation choices with a teammate.

Tell me about a feature you‚Äôre proud of from this project.

Describe a time when you made a mistake. How did you recover?

‚úÖ Bonus: Project-Specific Follow-ups
These are tricky, based on what you already said in your summary:

How did the Merchant Portal interact with the analytics system?

Can you explain how the loyalty tiers and point expiration were implemented?

What was the most complex feature you built in the Merchant Portal?

How does the system handle concurrent point redemptions?

Would you like me to:

Prioritize top 20 questions most likely to be asked?

Create sample answers for key technical/HR questions?

Or convert this into a Notion tracker / PDF interview prep sheet?

Let me know how you‚Äôd like to proceed next.
