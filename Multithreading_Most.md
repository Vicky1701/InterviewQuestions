## üöÄ INTERVIEW SURVIVAL TIPS

### Core Concepts You Must Explain Clearly:
1. **Thread Creation**: Two ways - extend Thread vs implement Runnable
2. **Synchronization**: Why needed and how synchronized keyword works
3. **Wait/Notify**: Inter-thread communication mechanism
4. **Thread States**: NEW, RUNNABLE, BLOCKED, WAITING, TERMINATED
5. **ExecutorService**: Modern way of managing threads

### Safe Answers to Have Ready:
- "Multithreading allows concurrent execution to improve performance and responsiveness"
- "I understand synchronization is crucial to prevent race conditions and data corruption"
- "I know the difference between thread creation approaches and when to use each"
- "I'm familiar with ExecutorService as the preferred way to manage thread pools"

### When Asked About Experience:
- "I understand multithreading concepts and have studied the fundamentals"
- "I know how to handle basic synchronization scenarios and thread communication"
- "I'm familiar with thread safety principles and can implement basic concurrent solutions"
- "I understand the importance of proper exception handling in multithreaded code"

## üìö QUICK REFERENCE - KEY DEFINITIONS

**Thread**: Lightweight subprocess that can run concurrently
**Synchronization**: Mechanism to control access to shared resources
**Monitor**: Object-level lock used for synchronization
**Race Condition**: Multiple threads accessing shared data simultaneously
**Deadlock**: Two or more threads blocked forever, waiting for each other
**Thread Pool**: Pre-created threads ready to execute tasks
**Atomic Operation**: Operation that completes in single step
**Volatile**: Keyword ensuring visibility of variable changes across threads
**Thread-Safe**: Code that functions correctly in multithreaded environment

---

## üîë ESSENTIAL USE CASES TO MENTION

1. **Web Servers**: Handling multiple client requests simultaneously
2. **Background Tasks**: Processing data while UI remains responsive
3. **Producer-Consumer**: One thread produces data, another consumes
4. **Parallel Processing**: Dividing work among multiple threads
5. **I/O Operations**: Non-blocking file/network operations
6. **Real-time Systems**: Time-sensitive applications requiring concurrency

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

- Don't confuse start() with run() method
- Remember that wait() must be called inside synchronized block
- Understand that volatile doesn't guarantee atomicity
- Know that synchronized methods use 'this' as monitor object
- Remember thread safety doesn't automatically mean performance
- Don't forget that daemon threads don't prevent JVM shutdown
- Avoid creating too many threads - use thread pools instead
