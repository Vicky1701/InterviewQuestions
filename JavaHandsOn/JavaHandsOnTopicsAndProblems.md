### 6. Multi-threading & Concurrency

- Create two threads that print numbers alternately.
- Demonstrate synchronization with a shared counter.

### 7. String Manipulation

- Check if a string is a palindrome.
- Find all anagrams in a list of strings.

### 8. Database Connectivity (JDBC)

- Write code to insert and fetch records from a database table.

### 9. REST API Basics

- Create a Spring Boot REST controller with GET and POST endpoints.

### 10. Unit Testing (JUnit)

- Write a JUnit test for a method that adds two numbers.

### 11. Design Patterns (Basics)

- Implement Singleton pattern for a configuration class.

### 12. Sorting & Searching Algorithms
