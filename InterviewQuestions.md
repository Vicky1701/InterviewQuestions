# Java Interview Questions and Answers

## 1. Core Java & Java 8+

### Question 1: What are the main features of Java 8+ that you find most beneficial for development?
**Answer:** Java 8 introduced Lambda Expressions, Stream API, Functional Interfaces, Optional, new Date-Time API, and default/static methods in interfaces. These features enable functional programming, concise code, and safer handling of nulls. For example, Stream API allows for efficient data processing: `list.stream().filter(x -> x > 10).collect(Collectors.toList());`.
**Conclusion:** Java 8+ features improve code readability, maintainability, and performance.

### Question 2: Explain the difference between == and equals() method in Java.
**Answer:** `==` compares object references, checking if two references point to the same object. `equals()` compares the actual content or state of objects. For example, two String objects with the same value return true with `equals()` but false with `==` if they are different objects.
**Conclusion:** Use `equals()` for logical equality, `==` for reference equality.

### Question 3: How do lambda expressions work in Java 8, and when would you use them?
**Answer:** Lambda expressions provide a concise way to implement functional interfaces. Syntax: `(parameters) -> expression`. They are used for passing behavior, especially in collections and stream operations. Example: `list.forEach(item -> System.out.println(item));`
**Conclusion:** Use lambdas to simplify code and enable functional programming.

### Question 4: What is the Stream API, and how does it improve code readability?
**Answer:** The Stream API processes sequences of elements in a functional style, supporting operations like filter, map, and reduce. It enables concise and readable data manipulation. Example: `list.stream().map(String::toUpperCase).collect(Collectors.toList());`
**Conclusion:** Stream API leads to more expressive and maintainable code.

### Question 5: Explain the concept of Optional in Java 8 and its benefits.
**Answer:** `Optional` is a container that may or may not hold a non-null value, helping to avoid null pointer exceptions. Example: `Optional.ofNullable(value).ifPresent(System.out::println);`
**Conclusion:** Use Optional to write safer, more robust code.

### Question 6: What are functional interfaces, and can you name a few built-in ones?
**Answer:** A functional interface has one abstract method and can be implemented with a lambda. Examples:
- Function<T, R> – Takes T and returns R
- Predicate<T> – Returns boolean
- Consumer<T> – Performs an action
- Supplier<T> – Provides a value
- Runnable – Runs code without parameters or return
**Conclusion:** Functional interfaces enable functional programming in Java.

### Question 7: How does garbage collection work in Java, and what are the different types?
**Answer:** Garbage collection automatically frees memory by removing unreachable objects. 
**How It Works:**
- JVM identifies unreachable objects (those with no references).
- GC process clears those objects to free heap memory.
**Types of Garbage Collectors:**
- Serial GC – Single-threaded, for small apps.
- Parallel GC – Multi-threaded, default in many JVMs.
- CMS (Concurrent Mark Sweep) – Low pause time.
- G1 (Garbage First) – Balances throughput and low pause time.
- ZGC / Shenandoah (Java 11+) – Ultra-low latency.
**Conclusion:** Understanding GC helps optimize application performance.

### Question 8: Explain the difference between HashMap and ConcurrentHashMap.
**Answer:** `HashMap` 
***What is a HashMap?***
- Stores key-value pairs.
- Not synchronized → Multiple threads modifying it can lead to data corruption.
  
***What is a ConcurrentHashMap?***
- A thread-safe version of HashMap.
- Internally divides the map into segments or buckets, each with its own lock (in earlier versions).
- In Java 8+, it uses bucket-level locking via synchronized blocks.
  
**Conclusion:** Use `ConcurrentHashMap` for thread-safe operations.

### Question 9: What is the difference between synchronized and volatile keywords?
**Answer:** 
***Synchronized***

**What is synchronized?**
- Makes a block or method mutually exclusive — only one thread at a time can execute it
- Ensures both **atomicity** and **visibility**
- Can be applied to methods or code blocks

### Example:
```java
synchronized void increment() {
    counter++; // Only one thread can execute this at a time
}

// Or using synchronized block
void updateData() {
    synchronized(this) {
        // Critical section - only one thread at a time
        data.add(newValue);
        counter++;
    }
}
```

***Use When:***
- You need to execute compound operations (read-modify-write) safely in multi-threaded code
- Examples: updating counters, modifying shared collections, complex state changes
- Multiple threads need to modify the same resource

---

***Volatile***

**What is volatile?**
- Used for **variables only** (not methods or blocks)
- Ensures changes made by one thread are immediately **visible** to other threads
- Does **NOT** ensure atomicity for compound operations

***Example***
```java
private volatile boolean running = true;

public void stop() {
    running = false; // Change is immediately visible to other threads
}

public void run() {
    while (running) {
        // Do work...
    }
}
```

***Use When:***
- You have a **single writer** and **multiple readers**
- Common use cases: flags like `isRunning`, `isStopped`, configuration values
- Simple assignments where atomicity isn't required

---

***Key Differences***

| Aspect | Synchronized | Volatile |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Scope** | Methods/blocks | Variables only |
| **Atomicity** | ✅ Guaranteed | ❌ Not guaranteed |
| **Visibility** | ✅ Guaranteed | ✅ Guaranteed |
| **Performance** | Slower (blocking) | Faster (non-blocking) |
| **Use Case** | Complex operations | Simple flag/state variables |

---

***When to Use Which?***

***Use `synchronized` when:***
- Multiple threads modify the same data
- You need atomic compound operations
- Thread safety is critical for complex state changes

***Use `volatile` when:***
- One thread writes, others only read
- Simple flag variables or configuration values
- You need visibility without the overhead of synchronization

***Example Comparison:***
```java
// ❌ Wrong - volatile doesn't make increment atomic
private volatile int counter = 0;
public void increment() {
    counter++; // Race condition possible!
}

// ✅ Correct - synchronized ensures atomicity
private int counter = 0;
public synchronized void increment() {
    counter++; // Thread-safe
}

// ✅ Correct - volatile perfect for flags
private volatile boolean stopRequested = false;
public void requestStop() {
    stopRequested = true; // Simple assignment, no race condition
}
```

### Question 10: How do you handle exceptions in Java, and what's the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions?
**Answer:** Exceptions are handled with try-catch blocks. Checked exceptions must be declared or handled; unchecked exceptions (RuntimeException) do not. Example: `IOException` (checked), `NullPointerException` (unchecked).

**Conclusion:** Handle checked exceptions explicitly; unchecked exceptions indicate programming errors.

### Question 11: Explain the concept of method references in Java 8

- Method references use the `::` operator to refer to methods directly, making code more concise and readable.
- They are a shorthand for lambda expressions that call existing methods.
- Types of method references:
  - Reference to a static method: `ClassName::staticMethod`
  - Reference to an instance method of a particular object: `instance::instanceMethod`
  - Reference to an instance method of an arbitrary object: `ClassName::instanceMethod`
  - Reference to a constructor: `ClassName::new`
- Example:

  ```java
  list.forEach(System.out::println);
  ```

### Question 12: What are the different types of memory areas in JVM

- **Method Area:** Stores class metadata, static variables, and method code.
- **Heap:** Stores all objects and their instance variables.
- **Stack:** Stores method call frames, local variables, and partial results.
- **Program Counter (PC) Register:** Tracks the current instruction for each thread.
- **Native Method Stack:** Used for native (non-Java) method calls.

### Question 13: How does the default keyword work in interfaces (Java 8)

- The `default` keyword allows interfaces to have concrete methods with a default implementation.
- Enables adding new methods to interfaces without breaking existing implementations.
- Syntax:

  ```java
  interface MyInterface {
      default void myMethod() { /* implementation */ }
  }
  ```
- Implementing classes can override default methods if needed.

### Question 14: Explain the difference between Comparable and Comparator

- **Comparable:**
  - Used for natural ordering of objects.
  - Must implement `compareTo()` method in the class.
  - Example: `public int compareTo(Object o)`
  - Used when objects have a single, default sort order.
- **Comparator:**
  - Used for custom ordering of objects.
  - Must implement `compare(Object o1, Object o2)` method.
  - Can be used to sort objects in multiple ways.

### Question 15: What is the difference between String, StringBuilder, and StringBuffer

- **String:**
  - Immutable; any modification creates a new object.
  - Thread-safe due to immutability.
- **StringBuilder:**
  - Mutable; can change content without creating new objects.
  - Not thread-safe; faster for single-threaded scenarios.
- **StringBuffer:**
  - Mutable and thread-safe (synchronized methods).
  - Slightly slower than StringBuilder due to synchronization.

### Question 16: How do you implement multithreading in Java

- **Extending Thread class:** Override the `run()` method in a subclass of `Thread`.
- **Implementing Runnable interface:** Implement the `run()` method and pass the object to a `Thread`.
- **Using Executor framework:** Use `ExecutorService` for managing thread pools and asynchronous tasks.
- Example:

  ```java
  new Thread(() -> System.out.println("Hello")).start();
  ```

### Question 17: Explain the concept of immutability in Java with examples

- Immutable objects cannot be changed after creation.
- Benefits: thread-safety, simplicity, and safe sharing.
- Example: `String` is immutable.
- To create an immutable class:
  - Make the class `final`.
  - Make fields `private final`.
  - No setters; only getters.
  - Initialize fields via constructor.

### Question 18: What are the new date-time APIs introduced in Java 8

- **java.time.LocalDate:** Date without time.
- **java.time.LocalTime:** Time without date.
- **java.time.LocalDateTime:** Date and time without timezone.
- **java.time.ZonedDateTime:** Date and time with timezone.
- **java.time.Duration/Period:** Amount of time or date difference.
- All are immutable and thread-safe, replacing older `Date` and `Calendar` classes.

### Question 19: How does method overloading and overriding work in Java

- **Overloading:**
  - Same method name, different parameter lists within the same class.
  - Compile-time polymorphism.
- **Overriding:**
  - Subclass provides a specific implementation of a method declared in its superclass.
  - Run-time polymorphism.
  - Method signature must be the same.

### Question 20: Explain the concept of generics in Java

- Generics enable classes, interfaces, and methods to operate on types specified by the programmer.
- Provide compile-time type safety and eliminate the need for type casting.
- Example:

  ```java
  List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
  ```
- Prevents runtime `ClassCastException`.

### Question 21: What is the difference between abstract class and interface
- An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods (without implementation) and concrete methods (with implementation).
- An interface is a contract that specifies method signatures without implementation (until Java 7).
  From Java 8 onward, interfaces can contain default and static methods with implementation, and from Java 9 onward, private methods too
  
- **Abstract Class:**
  - Can have abstract and concrete methods.
  - Can have state (fields).
  - Supports constructors.
  - Single inheritance.
- **Interface:**
  - Only abstract methods (Java 8+: default/static methods allowed).
  - No state (except static/final fields).
  - No constructors.
  - Multiple inheritance (a class can implement multiple interfaces).

### Question 22: How do you handle memory leaks in Java applications?

- Use tools like VisualVM, Eclipse MAT, or Java Flight Recorder to detect memory leaks.
- Always remove unused object references, especially in static fields and collections.
- Be careful with listeners, caches, and thread-local variables; unregister or clear them when not needed.
- Use weak references for objects that can be garbage collected.
- Regularly profile and monitor memory usage in production.

### Question 23: Explain the concept of reflection in Java

- Reflection allows inspection and modification of classes, methods, and fields at runtime.
- Enables dynamic object creation, method invocation, and access to private members.
- Used in frameworks (e.g., Spring, Hibernate), serialization, and testing tools.
- Example:

  ```java
  Class<?> clazz = Class.forName("java.util.ArrayList");
  Method m = clazz.getMethod("size");
  Object result = m.invoke(new ArrayList<>());
  ```
- Use reflection carefully; it can impact performance and security.

### Question 24: What are the different types of collections in Java?

- **List:** Ordered collection, allows duplicates (e.g., ArrayList, LinkedList).
- **Set:** Unordered, no duplicates (e.g., HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet).
- **Queue/Deque:** For FIFO/LIFO operations (e.g., LinkedList, ArrayDeque, PriorityQueue).
- **Map:** Key-value pairs, no duplicate keys (e.g., HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap).

### Question 25: How does the forEach method work with collections?

- `forEach` is a default method in the `Iterable` interface (Java 8+).
- Accepts a lambda expression or method reference to process each element.
- Example:

  ```java
  list.forEach(item -> System.out.println(item));
  // or
  list.forEach(System.out::println);
  ```
- Improves code readability and supports functional programming.

### Question 26: Explain the concept of thread safety in Java

- Thread safety means shared data is accessed and modified by multiple threads without causing data inconsistency.
- Achieved using synchronization, locks, thread-safe collections, and immutability.
- Use `synchronized`, `volatile`, `Atomic` classes, or concurrent collections (e.g., `ConcurrentHashMap`).
- Minimize shared mutable state to reduce synchronization needs.

### Question 27: What is the difference between final, finally, and finalize?

- **final:** Keyword to mark variables as constants, methods as non-overridable, and classes as non-inheritable.
- **finally:** Block in try-catch-finally; always executes after try/catch, used for cleanup.
- **finalize():** Method called by GC before object is collected (deprecated in Java 9+; avoid using).

### Question 28: How do you implement custom annotations in Java?

- Define annotation using `@interface`.
- Specify retention policy (`@Retention`) and target (`@Target`).
- Example:

  ```java
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
  @Target(ElementType.METHOD)
  public @interface MyAnnotation {
      String value();
  }
  ```
- Use reflection to process annotations at runtime.

### Question 29: Explain the concept of serialization and deserialization

- **Serialization:** Converting an object into a byte stream for storage or transmission.
- **Deserialization:** Reconstructing the object from the byte stream.
- Implement `Serializable` interface to enable serialization.
- Use `ObjectOutputStream` and `ObjectInputStream` for writing/reading objects.
- Example:

  ```java
  ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("data.ser"));
  out.writeObject(obj);
  // ...
  ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream("data.ser"));
  MyClass obj = (MyClass) in.readObject();
  ```

### Question 30: What are the performance improvements in Java 11 and later versions?

- Improved JVM performance and reduced memory footprint.
- New garbage collectors: ZGC, Shenandoah (low-latency, scalable GC).
- Flight Recorder and Mission Control for better profiling.
- Enhanced String, Collection, and Stream APIs.
- Faster startup and lower resource usage in containers/cloud.
- New language features: var for lambda parameters, local-variable syntax for lambda, HTTP Client API, etc.

### Question 31: Explain the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList. When would you use each?

- **ArrayList:**
  - Backed by a dynamic array.
  - Fast random access (O(1)), slow insert/delete in the middle (O(n)).
  - Use when you need fast access and infrequent insertions/deletions.
- **LinkedList:**
  - Doubly-linked list.
  - Fast insert/delete at ends (O(1)), slow random access (O(n)).
  - Use when you need frequent insertions/deletions, especially at the ends.

### Question 32: What are design patterns? Explain Singleton, Factory, and Observer patterns with examples

- **Design patterns:** Reusable solutions to common software design problems.
- **Singleton:** Ensures only one instance of a class exists.
  ```java
  public class Singleton {
      private static final Singleton instance = new Singleton();
      private Singleton() {}
      public static Singleton getInstance() { return instance; }
  }
  ```
- **Factory:** Creates objects without exposing instantiation logic.
  ```java
  public interface Shape { }
  public class Circle implements Shape { }
  public class ShapeFactory {
      public Shape getShape(String type) {
          if (type.equals("circle")) return new Circle();
          // ...
      }
  }
  ```
- **Observer:** Notifies multiple objects about state changes.
  ```java
  public interface Observer { void update(); }
  public class Subject {
      private List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();
      public void addObserver(Observer o) { observers.add(o); }
      public void notifyAllObservers() { observers.forEach(Observer::update); }
  }
  ```

### Question 33: How does HashMap work internally? What happens during collision?

- HashMap uses an array of buckets; each key's hashCode determines its bucket.
- On collision (same bucket), stores entries in a linked list (Java 8+: tree if many collisions).
- When adding, checks for existing key (equals/hashCode), updates value if found.
- Good hashCode implementation reduces collisions; resizing occurs when load factor is exceeded.

### Question 34: Explain Java Memory Model and the concept of volatile keyword

- The Java Memory Model (JMM) defines how threads interact through memory and what behaviors are allowed in concurrent execution.
- It specifies rules for visibility, ordering, and atomicity of variable access.
- The `volatile` keyword ensures that changes to a variable are always visible to other threads (no caching), but does not guarantee atomicity for compound actions.
- Use `volatile` for variables that are read/written by multiple threads but do not require atomic operations.

### Question 35: How do you implement equals() and hashCode() methods? What is their contract?

- `equals()` checks logical equality; `hashCode()` returns an integer for hashing (e.g., in HashMap).
- Contract:
  - If two objects are equal (`equals()` returns true), they must have the same `hashCode()`.
  - If two objects have the same `hashCode()`, they may or may not be equal.
  - Consistency: `equals()` and `hashCode()` should consistently return the same result unless object state changes.
- Implementation tips:
  - Use all significant fields in both methods.
  - Use `Objects.equals()` and `Objects.hash()` for null safety and simplicity (Java 7+).

### Question 36: What is the difference between fail-fast and fail-safe iterators?

- **Fail-fast:** Throw `ConcurrentModificationException` if the collection is modified during iteration (e.g., `ArrayList`, `HashMap`).
- **Fail-safe:** Do not throw exceptions; iterate over a snapshot or copy (e.g., `CopyOnWriteArrayList`, `ConcurrentHashMap`).
- Fail-fast is faster but not safe for concurrent modification; fail-safe is safe but may not reflect real-time changes.

### Question 37: Explain JVM architecture and class loading mechanism

- JVM architecture includes Class Loader, Runtime Data Areas (Heap, Stack, Method Area, etc.), Execution Engine, and Native Interface.
- **Class loading:**
  - Classes are loaded by Class Loaders (Bootstrap, Extension, Application).
  - Loading: Reads class bytecode.
  - Linking: Verifies, prepares, and (optionally) resolves classes.
  - Initialization: Executes static initializers and static blocks.
- Class loading is lazy and hierarchical.

### Question 38: What are the differences between JDK, JRE, and JVM?

- **JVM (Java Virtual Machine):** Runs Java bytecode; platform-dependent implementation.
- **JRE (Java Runtime Environment):** JVM + core libraries + supporting files; used to run Java applications.
- **JDK (Java Development Kit):** JRE + development tools (compiler, debugger, etc.); used to develop Java applications.

### Question 39: How do you optimize Java application performance?

- Profile and monitor with tools (JVisualVM, JMC, profilers).
- Use efficient data structures and algorithms.
- Minimize object creation; reuse objects where possible.
- Tune JVM parameters (heap size, GC options).
- Use caching, lazy loading, and connection pooling.
- Avoid synchronization bottlenecks; use concurrent collections.
- Optimize SQL queries and I/O operations.

### Question 40: What is the difference between composition and inheritance?

- **Inheritance:** IS-A relationship; subclass inherits behavior from superclass.
  - Promotes code reuse but can lead to tight coupling.
- **Composition:** HAS-A relationship; class contains references to other objects.
  - Promotes flexibility and loose coupling; preferred for code reuse.
- Favor composition over inheritance for better maintainability.

### Question 41: What are the different types of references in Java?

- **Strong Reference:** Default; prevents GC of the object.
- **Soft Reference:** Cleared only when memory is low; used for caches.
- **Weak Reference:** Cleared at next GC; used for memory-sensitive caches, WeakHashMap.
- **Phantom Reference:** Used for post-mortem cleanup; enqueued after object is finalized.

### Question 42: How do you implement producer-consumer pattern in Java?

- Use shared queue (e.g., `BlockingQueue`) for communication between producer and consumer threads.
- Producer adds items; consumer removes items.
- Use synchronization, wait/notify, or higher-level concurrency utilities.
- Example with `BlockingQueue`:

  ```java
  BlockingQueue<Integer> queue = new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(10);
  // Producer
  queue.put(item);
  // Consumer
  Integer item = queue.take();
  ```

### Question 43: What is the difference between static and non-static methods?

- **Static methods:** Belong to the class, not instances; can be called without creating an object.
  - Cannot access instance variables/methods directly.
- **Non-static methods:** Belong to object instances; can access instance and static members.
- Use static methods for utility or helper functions.

### Question 44: What are nested classes in Java? When would you use them?

- Nested classes are classes defined within another class.
- Types:
  - **Static nested class:** Like a static member; cannot access outer class instance members.
  - **Inner class:** Non-static; can access outer class instance members.
  - **Local class:** Defined within a method.
  - **Anonymous class:** No name; used for one-off implementations (e.g., event handlers).
- Use nested classes to logically group classes, increase encapsulation, or for helper classes only used by the outer class.

**Answer:**
- Enable caching with `@EnableCaching`.
- Use `@Cacheable`, `@CachePut`, and `@CacheEvict` annotations.
- Supports various cache providers (e.g., EhCache, Redis).
**Conclusion:** Caching improves performance by reducing redundant operations.

### Question: Explain the concept of profiles in Spring Boot
**Answer:**
- Profiles allow grouping of configuration for different environments (dev, test, prod).
- Activate profiles with `spring.profiles.active` property.
- Use `@Profile` annotation for beans.
**Conclusion:** Profiles enable environment-specific configuration and deployment.

### Question: How do you secure a Spring Boot application?
**Answer:**
- Use Spring Security for authentication and authorization.
- Configure security via `SecurityConfig` class or properties.
- Support for OAuth2, JWT, LDAP, and custom authentication.
**Conclusion:** Spring Security provides robust, customizable security for applications.

### Question: What is the difference between @RequestParam and @PathVariable?
**Answer:**
- `@RequestParam`: Extracts query parameters from the URL (e.g., `/api?name=John`).
- `@PathVariable`: Extracts values from the URI path (e.g., `/api/user/1`).
- Both used to pass data to controller methods.
**Conclusion:** Use based on whether data is in the query string or path segment.
