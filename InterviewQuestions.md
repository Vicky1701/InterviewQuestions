# Java Interview Questions and Answers

## 1. Core Java & Java 8+

### Question 1: What are the main features of Java 8+ that you find most beneficial for development?
**Answer:** Java 8 introduced Lambda Expressions, Stream API, Functional Interfaces, Optional, new Date-Time API, and default/static methods in interfaces. These features enable functional programming, concise code, and safer handling of nulls. For example, Stream API allows for efficient data processing: `list.stream().filter(x -> x > 10).collect(Collectors.toList());`.
**Conclusion:** Java 8+ features improve code readability, maintainability, and performance.

### Question 2: Explain the difference between == and equals() method in Java.
**Answer:** `==` compares object references, checking if two references point to the same object. `equals()` compares the actual content or state of objects. For example, two String objects with the same value return true with `equals()` but false with `==` if they are different objects.
**Conclusion:** Use `equals()` for logical equality, `==` for reference equality.

### Question 3: How do lambda expressions work in Java 8, and when would you use them?
**Answer:** Lambda expressions provide a concise way to implement functional interfaces. Syntax: `(parameters) -> expression`. They are used for passing behavior, especially in collections and stream operations. Example: `list.forEach(item -> System.out.println(item));`
**Conclusion:** Use lambdas to simplify code and enable functional programming.

### Question 4: What is the Stream API, and how does it improve code readability?
**Answer:** The Stream API processes sequences of elements in a functional style, supporting operations like filter, map, and reduce. It enables concise and readable data manipulation. Example: `list.stream().map(String::toUpperCase).collect(Collectors.toList());`
**Conclusion:** Stream API leads to more expressive and maintainable code.

### Question 5: Explain the concept of Optional in Java 8 and its benefits.
**Answer:** `Optional` is a container that may or may not hold a non-null value, helping to avoid null pointer exceptions. Example: `Optional.ofNullable(value).ifPresent(System.out::println);`
**Conclusion:** Use Optional to write safer, more robust code.

### Question 6: What are functional interfaces, and can you name a few built-in ones?
**Answer:** A functional interface has one abstract method and can be implemented with a lambda. Examples:
- Function<T, R> – Takes T and returns R
- Predicate<T> – Returns boolean
- Consumer<T> – Performs an action
- Supplier<T> – Provides a value
- Runnable – Runs code without parameters or return
**Conclusion:** Functional interfaces enable functional programming in Java.

### Question 7: How does garbage collection work in Java, and what are the different types?
**Answer:** Garbage collection automatically frees memory by removing unreachable objects. 
**How It Works:**
- JVM identifies unreachable objects (those with no references).
- GC process clears those objects to free heap memory.
**Types of Garbage Collectors:**
- Serial GC – Single-threaded, for small apps.
- Parallel GC – Multi-threaded, default in many JVMs.
- CMS (Concurrent Mark Sweep) – Low pause time.
- G1 (Garbage First) – Balances throughput and low pause time.
- ZGC / Shenandoah (Java 11+) – Ultra-low latency.
**Conclusion:** Understanding GC helps optimize application performance.

### Question 8: Explain the difference between HashMap and ConcurrentHashMap.
**Answer:** `HashMap` 
***What is a HashMap?***
- Stores key-value pairs.
- Not synchronized → Multiple threads modifying it can lead to data corruption.
  
***What is a ConcurrentHashMap?***
- A thread-safe version of HashMap.
- Internally divides the map into segments or buckets, each with its own lock (in earlier versions).
- In Java 8+, it uses bucket-level locking via synchronized blocks.
  
**Conclusion:** Use `ConcurrentHashMap` for thread-safe operations.

### Question 9: What is the difference between synchronized and volatile keywords?
**Answer:** 
***Synchronized***

**What is synchronized?**
- Makes a block or method mutually exclusive — only one thread at a time can execute it
- Ensures both **atomicity** and **visibility**
- Can be applied to methods or code blocks

### Example:
```java
synchronized void increment() {
    counter++; // Only one thread can execute this at a time
}

// Or using synchronized block
void updateData() {
    synchronized(this) {
        // Critical section - only one thread at a time
        data.add(newValue);
        counter++;
    }
}
```

***Use When:***
- You need to execute compound operations (read-modify-write) safely in multi-threaded code
- Examples: updating counters, modifying shared collections, complex state changes
- Multiple threads need to modify the same resource

---

***Volatile***

**What is volatile?**
- Used for **variables only** (not methods or blocks)
- Ensures changes made by one thread are immediately **visible** to other threads
- Does **NOT** ensure atomicity for compound operations

***Example***
```java
private volatile boolean running = true;

public void stop() {
    running = false; // Change is immediately visible to other threads
}

public void run() {
    while (running) {
        // Do work...
    }
}
```

***Use When:***
- You have a **single writer** and **multiple readers**
- Common use cases: flags like `isRunning`, `isStopped`, configuration values
- Simple assignments where atomicity isn't required

---

***Key Differences***

| Aspect | Synchronized | Volatile |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Scope** | Methods/blocks | Variables only |
| **Atomicity** | ✅ Guaranteed | ❌ Not guaranteed |
| **Visibility** | ✅ Guaranteed | ✅ Guaranteed |
| **Performance** | Slower (blocking) | Faster (non-blocking) |
| **Use Case** | Complex operations | Simple flag/state variables |

---

***When to Use Which?***

***Use `synchronized` when:***
- Multiple threads modify the same data
- You need atomic compound operations
- Thread safety is critical for complex state changes

***Use `volatile` when:***
- One thread writes, others only read
- Simple flag variables or configuration values
- You need visibility without the overhead of synchronization

***Example Comparison:***
```java
// ❌ Wrong - volatile doesn't make increment atomic
private volatile int counter = 0;
public void increment() {
    counter++; // Race condition possible!
}

// ✅ Correct - synchronized ensures atomicity
private int counter = 0;
public synchronized void increment() {
    counter++; // Thread-safe
}

// ✅ Correct - volatile perfect for flags
private volatile boolean stopRequested = false;
public void requestStop() {
    stopRequested = true; // Simple assignment, no race condition
}
```

### Question 10: How do you handle exceptions in Java, and what's the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions?
**Answer:** Exceptions are handled with try-catch blocks. Checked exceptions must be declared or handled; unchecked exceptions (RuntimeException) do not. Example: `IOException` (checked), `NullPointerException` (unchecked).

**Conclusion:** Handle checked exceptions explicitly; unchecked exceptions indicate programming errors.

### Question 11: Explain the concept of method references in Java 8

- Method references use the `::` operator to refer to methods directly, making code more concise and readable.
- They are a shorthand for lambda expressions that call existing methods.
- Types of method references:
  - Reference to a static method: `ClassName::staticMethod`
  - Reference to an instance method of a particular object: `instance::instanceMethod`
  - Reference to an instance method of an arbitrary object: `ClassName::instanceMethod`
  - Reference to a constructor: `ClassName::new`
- Example:

  ```java
  list.forEach(System.out::println);
  ```

### Question 12: What are the different types of memory areas in JVM

- **Method Area:** Stores class metadata, static variables, and method code.
- **Heap:** Stores all objects and their instance variables.
- **Stack:** Stores method call frames, local variables, and partial results.
- **Program Counter (PC) Register:** Tracks the current instruction for each thread.
- **Native Method Stack:** Used for native (non-Java) method calls.

### Question 13: How does the default keyword work in interfaces (Java 8)

- The `default` keyword allows interfaces to have concrete methods with a default implementation.
- Enables adding new methods to interfaces without breaking existing implementations.
- Syntax:

  ```java
  interface MyInterface {
      default void myMethod() { /* implementation */ }
  }
  ```
- Implementing classes can override default methods if needed.

### Question 14: Explain the difference between Comparable and Comparator

- **Comparable:**
  - Used for natural ordering of objects.
  - Must implement `compareTo()` method in the class.
  - Example: `public int compareTo(Object o)`
  - Used when objects have a single, default sort order.
- **Comparator:**
  - Used for custom ordering of objects.
  - Must implement `compare(Object o1, Object o2)` method.
  - Can be used to sort objects in multiple ways.

### Question 15: What is the difference between String, StringBuilder, and StringBuffer

- **String:**
  - Immutable; any modification creates a new object.
  - Thread-safe due to immutability.
- **StringBuilder:**
  - Mutable; can change content without creating new objects.
  - Not thread-safe; faster for single-threaded scenarios.
- **StringBuffer:**
  - Mutable and thread-safe (synchronized methods).
  - Slightly slower than StringBuilder due to synchronization.

### Question 16: How do you implement multithreading in Java

- **Extending Thread class:** Override the `run()` method in a subclass of `Thread`.
- **Implementing Runnable interface:** Implement the `run()` method and pass the object to a `Thread`.
- **Using Executor framework:** Use `ExecutorService` for managing thread pools and asynchronous tasks.
- Example:

  ```java
  new Thread(() -> System.out.println("Hello")).start();
  ```

### Question 17: Explain the concept of immutability in Java with examples

- Immutable objects cannot be changed after creation.
- Benefits: thread-safety, simplicity, and safe sharing.
- Example: `String` is immutable.
- To create an immutable class:
  - Make the class `final`.
  - Make fields `private final`.
  - No setters; only getters.
  - Initialize fields via constructor.

### Question 18: What are the new date-time APIs introduced in Java 8

- **java.time.LocalDate:** Date without time.
- **java.time.LocalTime:** Time without date.
- **java.time.LocalDateTime:** Date and time without timezone.
- **java.time.ZonedDateTime:** Date and time with timezone.
- **java.time.Duration/Period:** Amount of time or date difference.
- All are immutable and thread-safe, replacing older `Date` and `Calendar` classes.

### Question 19: How does method overloading and overriding work in Java

- **Overloading:**
  - Same method name, different parameter lists within the same class.
  - Compile-time polymorphism.
- **Overriding:**
  - Subclass provides a specific implementation of a method declared in its superclass.
  - Run-time polymorphism.
  - Method signature must be the same.

### Question 20: Explain the concept of generics in Java

- Generics enable classes, interfaces, and methods to operate on types specified by the programmer.
- Provide compile-time type safety and eliminate the need for type casting.
- Example:

  ```java
  List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
  ```
- Prevents runtime `ClassCastException`.

### Question 21: What is the difference between abstract class and interface

- **Abstract Class:**
  - Can have abstract and concrete methods.
  - Can have state (fields).
  - Supports constructors.
  - Single inheritance.
- **Interface:**
  - Only abstract methods (Java 8+: default/static methods allowed).
  - No state (except static/final fields).
  - No constructors.
  - Multiple inheritance (a class can implement multiple interfaces).

### Question: How do you handle memory leaks in Java applications?
**Answer:**
- Avoid holding unnecessary object references.
- Use weak references for cache or listeners.
- Close resources (files, streams, DB connections) promptly.
- Use profiling tools (e.g., VisualVM) to detect leaks.
**Conclusion:** Proactive resource management and profiling prevent memory leaks.

### Question: Explain the concept of reflection in Java
**Answer:**
- Reflection allows inspection and modification of classes, methods, and fields at runtime.
- Used for frameworks, dependency injection, and testing.
- Example: `Class.forName("com.example.MyClass")`.
- Can impact performance and security.
**Conclusion:** Use reflection judiciously for dynamic behavior.

### Question: What are the different types of collections in Java?

**Conclusion:** `forEach` simplifies iteration and improves code readability.

### Question: Explain the concept of thread safety in Java
**Answer:**
- Thread safety ensures correct behavior when multiple threads access shared data.
- Achieved via synchronization, concurrent collections, and immutability.
- Example: Using `synchronized` blocks or `ConcurrentHashMap`.
**Conclusion:** Thread safety is critical for reliable concurrent applications.

### Question: What is the difference between final, finally, and finalize?
**Answer:**
- `final`: Keyword to mark variables as constants, methods as non-overridable, and classes as non-inheritable.
- `finally`: Block in exception handling that always executes.
- `finalize()`: Method called by GC before object removal (deprecated in recent Java).
**Conclusion:** Each serves a distinct purpose in Java’s type, exception, and memory management.

### Question: How do you implement custom annotations in Java?
**Answer:**
- Define with `@interface` keyword.
- Can specify retention policy and target.
- Example:
  ```java
  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
  @Target(ElementType.METHOD)
  public @interface MyAnnotation {}
  ```
**Conclusion:** Custom annotations enable metadata-driven programming.

### Question: Explain the concept of serialization and deserialization
**Answer:**

- `LinkedList` uses a doubly-linked list; fast insert/delete, slow random access.
- Use `ArrayList` for frequent access, `LinkedList` for frequent insertions/deletions.
**Conclusion:** Choose based on access vs. modification needs.

### Question: What are design patterns? Explain Singleton, Factory, and Observer patterns with examples.
**Answer:**
- Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems.
- Singleton: Ensures a class has only one instance. Example: `private static final Singleton INSTANCE = new Singleton();`
- Factory: Creates objects without exposing instantiation logic. Example: `ShapeFactory.getShape("CIRCLE");`
- Observer: Notifies dependent objects of state changes. Example: `Observer` interface in Java.
**Conclusion:** Patterns improve code reusability and maintainability.

### Question: How does HashMap work internally? What happens during collision?
**Answer:**
- HashMap uses an array of buckets and hash function.
- On collision, stores entries in a linked list or tree (Java 8+).
- Good hashCode and equals implementations reduce collisions.
**Conclusion:** Understanding internals helps optimize performance and avoid bugs.

### Question: Explain Java Memory Model and the concept of volatile keyword.
**Answer:**
- Java Memory Model defines how threads interact through memory.
- `volatile` ensures visibility of changes to variables across threads.
- Does not guarantee atomicity.
**Conclusion:** Use `volatile` for visibility, not for atomic operations.

### Question: How do you implement equals() and hashCode() methods? What is their contract?
**Answer:**
- `equals()` checks logical equality; `hashCode()` returns an int for hashing.
- Contract: Equal objects must have equal hash codes.
- Use IDE or Objects.equals/hash for implementation.
**Conclusion:** Proper implementation ensures correct behavior in collections.

### Question: What is the difference between fail-fast and fail-safe iterators?
**Answer:**
- Fail-fast: Throw `ConcurrentModificationException` if collection modified during iteration (e.g., ArrayList).
- Fail-safe: Work on a copy, do not throw exception (e.g., ConcurrentHashMap).
**Conclusion:** Fail-safe is safer for concurrent modifications.

### Question: Explain JVM architecture and class loading mechanism.
**Answer:**
- JVM consists of class loader, memory areas, execution engine, and native interface.
- Class loader loads classes in stages: Bootstrap, Extension, Application.
- Verifies, prepares, and initializes classes before execution.
**Conclusion:** JVM architecture enables platform independence and security.

### Question: What are the differences between JDK, JRE, and JVM?
**Answer:**
- JVM: Runs Java bytecode, platform-dependent.
- JRE: JVM + libraries for running Java apps.

**Conclusion:** JDK is for development, JRE for running, JVM for execution.

### Question: How do you optimize Java application performance?
**Answer:**
- Use efficient algorithms and data structures.
- Profile and monitor memory/CPU usage.
- Tune JVM parameters (heap size, GC).
- Minimize synchronization and I/O bottlenecks.
**Conclusion:** Continuous profiling and tuning yield best performance.

### Question: What is the difference between composition and inheritance?
**Answer:**
- Inheritance: IS-A relationship; subclass extends superclass.
- Composition: HAS-A relationship; class contains references to other objects.
- Composition offers more flexibility and loose coupling.
**Conclusion:** Prefer composition over inheritance for better design.

### Question: What are the different types of references in Java?
**Answer:**
- Strong: Default, prevents GC.
- Soft: Cleared before OutOfMemoryError.
- Weak: Cleared at next GC.
- Phantom: Used for cleanup before GC.
**Conclusion:** Use reference types for memory-sensitive applications.

### Question: How do you implement producer-consumer pattern in Java?
**Answer:**
- Use shared queue (e.g., `BlockingQueue`) for communication.
- Producer adds items; consumer removes items.
- Synchronization or concurrent collections ensure thread safety.
- Example: `ArrayBlockingQueue` with multiple producer/consumer threads.
**Conclusion:** Use concurrent collections for efficient and safe producer-consumer implementation.

### Question: What is the difference between static and non-static methods?
**Answer:**
- Static methods belong to the class; called without an object.
- Non-static methods belong to instances; require an object to call.
- Static methods cannot access instance variables directly.
**Conclusion:** Use static for utility or class-level logic, non-static for object-specific behavior.

### Question: What are nested classes in Java? When would you use them?
**Answer:**
- Classes defined within another class.
- Types: static nested, non-static inner, local, and anonymous.
- Used for logical grouping, encapsulation, or event handling.
**Conclusion:** Use nested classes to organize code and encapsulate helper logic.
