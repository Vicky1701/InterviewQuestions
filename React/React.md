# React Interview Questions - Complete Guide

## Core React Concepts

1. **What is Virtual DOM? How does it improve performance?**
2. **Explain the difference between class and functional components.**
3. **What are props vs. state? When would you use each?**
4. **Explain React component lifecycle methods (for class components).**
5. **What are keys in React? Why are they important in lists?**

## React Hooks (Most Important)

2. **How does `useEffect` dependency array work?**
3. **What is the purpose of `useCallback` and `useMemo`? Give practical use cases.**
4. **Explain `useRef` and its common use cases (accessing DOM, persisting values).**
5. **How would you share state between components? (Context API, prop drilling, state management)**

## State Management

1. **When would you use React Context vs. Redux?**
2. **Explain how Redux works (store, actions, reducers).**
3. **What is the difference between Redux Thunk and Redux Saga?**
4. **How would you optimize a React app with heavy state usage?**

## Advanced React Patterns

2. **Explain React Render Props pattern.**
3. **What is React Fiber?**
4. **How does React handle server-side rendering (SSR)?**

## React Router

1. **How do you implement routing in React?**
2. **Difference between `BrowserRouter` and `HashRouter`.**
3. **How would you protect routes (e.g., authentication)?**

## Performance Optimization

1. **How would you optimize a slow React application?**
2. **What is code splitting in React? How do you implement it?**
3. **Explain lazy loading components in React.**
4. **How does `React.memo()` work? When should you use it?**

## React & JavaScript Integration

1. **How does event handling differ in React vs. vanilla JS?**
2. **Explain how to bind `this` in React event handlers (for class components).**
3. **How would you handle forms in React (controlled vs. uncontrolled)?**

## Practical Coding Problems (Be Ready to Solve)
