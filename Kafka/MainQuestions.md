## üöÄ INTERVIEW SURVIVAL TIPS

### Core Concepts You Must Explain Clearly:
1. **What Kafka is**: Distributed streaming platform for real-time data
2. **Topics & Partitions**: How data is organized and distributed
3. **Producer/Consumer**: How applications interact with Kafka
4. **Consumer Groups**: How consumers work together for scalability
5. **Replication**: How Kafka ensures fault tolerance

### Safe Answers to Have Ready:
- "Kafka is a distributed streaming platform used for building real-time data pipelines"
- "I understand Kafka's pub-sub model and how it differs from traditional message queues"
- "I know the importance of partitioning for scalability and parallelism"
- "I'm familiar with producer-consumer patterns and consumer group concepts"

### When Asked About Experience:
- "I understand Kafka architecture and have studied producer-consumer implementations"
- "I'm familiar with Kafka concepts and ready to work with it in a production environment"
- "I've been learning Kafka fundamentals and understand its use cases in microservices"

## üìö QUICK REFERENCE - KEY DEFINITIONS

**Topic**: Category/feed name where records are published
**Partition**: Ordered, immutable sequence of records within a topic
**Broker**: Kafka server that stores data and serves client requests
**Producer**: Application that publishes records to topics
**Consumer**: Application that subscribes to topics and processes records
**Consumer Group**: Set of consumers that work together to consume a topic
**Offset**: Unique identifier of a record within a partition
**Replication Factor**: Number of copies of data across brokers
**Leader**: Primary replica that handles all reads and writes
**Follower**: Backup replica that replicates data from leader

---

## üîë ESSENTIAL USE CASES TO MENTION

1. **Real-time Analytics**: Processing streaming data for insights
2. **Event Sourcing**: Storing state changes as events
3. **Log Aggregation**: Collecting logs from multiple services
4. **Microservices Communication**: Decoupling services via events
5. **Data Pipeline**: Moving data between different systems
6. **Activity Tracking**: User behavior tracking and analytics

## ‚ö†Ô∏è COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

- Don't confuse Kafka with traditional message queues
- Remember that increasing partitions is possible, but decreasing is not
- Understand that message order is guaranteed only within a partition
- Know that Zookeeper is being phased out in favor of KRaft
- Remember that consumers in same group cannot read same partition simultaneously
