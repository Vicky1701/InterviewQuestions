## üéØ PRACTICE TIPS

### For Each Question Type:
1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic filter/map operations
2. **Add Complexity**: Combine multiple stream operations
3. **Use Collectors**: Practice groupingBy, joining, partitioning
4. **Method References**: Use :: syntax when possible
5. **Handle Edge Cases**: Empty lists, null values, etc.

### Common Patterns to Master:
- **Filter ‚Üí Map ‚Üí Collect**
- **Group By ‚Üí Count/Sum**
- **Partition ‚Üí Process Each Part**
- **FlatMap ‚Üí Flatten Collections**
- **Reduce ‚Üí Aggregate Operations**

### Key Methods to Practice:
- `filter()`, `map()`, `flatMap()`
- `collect()`, `reduce()`, `forEach()`
- `groupingBy()`, `partitioningBy()`, `joining()`
- `sorted()`, `distinct()`, `limit()`, `skip()`
- `anyMatch()`, `allMatch()`, `noneMatch()`
- `findFirst()`, `findAny()`, `count()`
