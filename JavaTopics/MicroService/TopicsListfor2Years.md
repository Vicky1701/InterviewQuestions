ðŸ”¹ 1. Microservices Basics

What are Microservices? Difference from Monolithic?

Advantages & disadvantages of microservices.

Characteristics of microservices (loose coupling, independent deployability, scalability).

Real-world examples where microservices fit.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Core Design Concepts

Service decomposition (how to break monolith into microservices).

Bounded Context (from Domain Driven Design).

API design best practices (REST, JSON, versioning).

Inter-service communication:

Synchronous â†’ REST, gRPC

Asynchronous â†’ Message brokers (Kafka, RabbitMQ)

ðŸ”¹ 3. Spring Boot + Spring Cloud (Java-specific if you are using it)

Creating microservices using Spring Boot.

Service discovery & registration â†’ Eureka / Consul / Zookeeper.

API Gateway â†’ Spring Cloud Gateway, Zuul.

Load Balancing â†’ Ribbon, Feign Client.

Circuit Breaker â†’ Resilience4j / Hystrix.

Configuration Management â†’ Spring Cloud Config.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Communication & Messaging

REST vs gRPC differences.

Event-driven communication â†’ Kafka, RabbitMQ basics.

Eventual consistency and why it's important in microservices.

ðŸ”¹ 5. Database & Transactions

Database per service principle.

How to handle distributed transactions (Saga pattern, 2PC).

Data consistency issues.

ðŸ”¹ 6. Security

Authentication & Authorization (JWT, OAuth2, Keycloak).

API Gateway role in security.

Best practices (service-to-service authentication, mTLS basics).

ðŸ”¹ 7. Deployment & Infrastructure

Containerization basics (Docker).

Orchestration basics (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm).

CI/CD pipelines for microservices.

Blue-green deployment, rolling updates.

ðŸ”¹ 8. Observability

Logging in microservices â†’ Centralized logging (ELK / Splunk).

Monitoring â†’ Prometheus, Grafana.

Distributed Tracing â†’ Zipkin, Jaeger.

Health checks & Actuator endpoints.

ðŸ”¹ 9. Resilience & Scalability

Retry mechanisms.

Rate limiting & throttling.

Circuit breaker pattern.

Caching strategies (Redis).
