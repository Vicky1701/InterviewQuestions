# Microservices Interview Questions and Answers (2 Years Experience)

---

**1. What are microservices? How are they different from monolithic architecture?**
Microservices is an architectural style where an application is composed of small, independent services that communicate over APIs. In monolithic architecture, all components are tightly coupled and run as a single unit. Microservices allow independent deployment and scaling, while monolithic apps require redeployment of the whole application for any change.

---

**2. What are the main benefits of using microservices?**
- Independent deployment and scaling
- Technology diversity
- Fault isolation
- Easier maintenance
- Better team autonomy

---

**3. Can you explain how communication happens between microservices?**
Microservices communicate using APIs, typically REST over HTTP or messaging protocols like RabbitMQ or Kafka. Communication can be synchronous (request/response) or asynchronous (event/message based).

---

**4. What is an API Gateway? Why is it used in microservices?**
An API Gateway is a server that acts as a single entry point for client requests. It handles routing, authentication, rate limiting, and aggregating responses from multiple services, simplifying client interactions and improving security.

---

**5. How do you handle data consistency across microservices?**
Data consistency is managed using patterns like Saga, event sourcing, or eventual consistency. Transactions are often distributed, and compensating actions are used to handle failures.

---

**6. What is service discovery? Name some tools used for it.**
Service discovery is the process of automatically detecting services in a network. Tools include Netflix Eureka, Consul, and Zookeeper.

---

**7. How do you manage configuration in microservices?**
Configuration is managed using centralized configuration servers (e.g., Spring Cloud Config), environment variables, or externalized configuration files.

---

**8. What is the role of Docker and containers in microservices?**
Docker containers package microservices with their dependencies, ensuring consistency across environments. Containers make deployment, scaling, and isolation easier.

---

**9. How do you monitor and log microservices?**
Monitoring and logging are done using tools like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Prometheus, Grafana, and centralized logging solutions. Distributed tracing helps track requests across services.

---

**10. What is circuit breaker pattern? Why is it important?**
The circuit breaker pattern prevents a service from repeatedly trying to execute an operation that's likely to fail, helping to avoid cascading failures and improve system resilience. Libraries like Hystrix implement this pattern.

---

**11. How do you handle security in microservices?**
Security is managed using authentication and authorization (OAuth2, JWT), API gateways, HTTPS, and secure communication between services.

---

**12. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous communication in microservices?**
Synchronous communication waits for a response (e.g., REST API), while asynchronous communication uses messaging or events, allowing services to process requests independently and improve scalability.

---

**13. How do you deploy microservices?**
Microservices are deployed using containers (Docker), orchestration tools (Kubernetes), CI/CD pipelines, and cloud platforms.

---

**14. What is the importance of scalability in microservices?**
Scalability allows services to handle increased load by scaling independently, improving performance and resource utilization.

---

**15. How do you test microservices?**
Testing includes unit, integration, contract, and end-to-end tests. Tools like JUnit, Postman, and WireMock are commonly used.

---

**16. What is the role of Spring Boot in building microservices?**
Spring Boot simplifies microservice development by providing embedded servers, auto-configuration, and integration with Spring Cloud for distributed systems features.

---

**17. What is the difference between REST and messaging in microservices?**
REST is synchronous and uses HTTP for communication. Messaging is asynchronous, using message brokers (Kafka, RabbitMQ) for decoupled communication.

---

**18. How do you handle failures in microservices?**
Failures are handled using retries, circuit breakers, fallback methods, and monitoring. Proper error handling and resilience patterns are important.

---

**19. What is the role of API versioning in microservices?**
API versioning allows changes to APIs without breaking existing clients. It helps manage backward compatibility and smooth transitions.

---

**20. Can you explain the concept of eventual consistency?**
Eventual consistency means that data updates will propagate to all services over time, and all copies will become consistent eventually. It's used when immediate consistency is not required.
