## **Additional Basic CI/CD Interview Questions**

### Q: What is CI/CD and why is it important?
**A:** "CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery. It helps automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code, ensuring faster and more reliable releases. It reduces manual errors and helps teams deliver features quickly."

### Q: What steps did you follow before pushing your code for deployment?
**A:** "I made sure my code passed all unit tests, followed coding standards, and was properly documented. I also checked that my microservice could run in a container and that configuration was externalized for different environments."

### Q: Have you ever fixed a build or deployment failure?
**A:** "Yes, sometimes my code changes caused build failures due to missing dependencies or test failures. I would check the pipeline logs, fix the issues, and push the changes again. For deployment issues, I worked with DevOps to troubleshoot and resolve them."

### Q: How do you ensure your code is ready for CI/CD?
**A:** "I write automated tests, follow best practices for code quality, and make sure my service can run in a container. I also add health check endpoints and externalize configuration so it works in different environments."

### Q: What tools did you use for CI/CD in your project?
**A:** "We used GitLab CI and Jenkins for our pipelines, Maven for building Java services, and SonarQube for code quality checks. Docker was used for containerization, and Kubernetes for orchestration."

### **1. "How was CI/CD implemented in your project?"**

**Answer:**
"In the MobiLytix project, we had a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for our 11 microservices. As a developer, I was responsible for writing the application code, unit tests, and ensuring my code passed through our automated pipeline.

Our process worked like this:
- I would commit my code to feature branches in GitLab
- The CI pipeline would automatically trigger, running Maven builds for our Spring Boot services
- Automated tests would run including unit tests, integration tests, and SonarQube code quality checks
- If all tests passed, the pipeline would build Docker images and push them to our container registry
- The DevOps team configured the deployment stages, but I could see the progress through GitLab CI interface
- We had separate pipelines for dev, staging, and production environments

My role was ensuring my code was 'CI/CD ready' - meaning proper test coverage, following coding standards, and ensuring services could start up correctly in containerized environments."

### **2. "What was your role in the deployment process?"**

**Answer:**
"While the DevOps team handled the infrastructure and deployment configurations, as a developer I had several important responsibilities:

- **Code Preparation:** I ensured my microservices were containerized properly with Dockerfiles and could run in different environments
- **Environment Configuration:** I worked with externalized configuration using Spring Boot profiles, so the same code could run in dev, staging, and production
- **Health Checks:** I implemented health check endpoints (`/actuator/health`) that the deployment system could use to verify service status
- **Database Migrations:** I wrote database migration scripts that could be executed automatically during deployment
- **Rollback Support:** I ensured my code changes were backward compatible and could be rolled back if needed
- **Monitoring Integration:** I added logging and metrics that integrated with our monitoring systems

When critical issues occurred in production, I would work closely with DevOps to troubleshoot and sometimes create hotfix branches that could be deployed quickly."

### **3. "How did you handle different environments (dev, staging, prod)?"**

**Answer:**
"We used Spring Boot profiles and externalized configuration to handle different environments:

- **Application Properties:** Different `application-{env}.properties` files for each environment
- **Database Connections:** Separate database instances for each environment with different connection strings
- **External Services:** Different API endpoints for third-party services (like SMS providers had sandbox vs production URLs)
- **Feature Flags:** We used configuration to enable/disable features in different environments
- **Logging Levels:** Different log levels for each environment (DEBUG for dev, INFO for staging, WARN for production)

The CI/CD pipeline would automatically select the right configuration based on the target environment. As a developer, I just needed to ensure my code worked with these different configurations."

- **RDS MySQL:** Our databases were hosted on AWS RDS. I worked with database connection configurations and ensured proper connection pooling for cloud environments
- **ElastiCache Redis:** We used AWS ElastiCache for Redis caching. I implemented caching logic in my code to work with this managed Redis service
- **S3 Storage:** We stored configuration files and backups in S3. I wrote code to read configuration from S3 when needed
- **CloudWatch:** I added custom metrics and logs that integrated with CloudWatch for monitoring

The cloud environment helped us achieve high availability and scalability, especially during peak traffic periods."

### **2. "How did you handle scalability in AWS?"**

**Answer:**
"While the DevOps team configured the auto-scaling policies, I designed my code to be cloud-native and scalable:

- **Stateless Services:** I ensured all our microservices were stateless, so they could be easily scaled horizontally
- **Database Connection Management:** I implemented proper connection pooling and connection lifecycle management to handle scaling
- **Caching Strategy:** I used Redis (ElastiCache) to reduce database load and improve response times during high traffic
- **Asynchronous Processing:** I used message queues (Kafka/SQS) for non-critical operations to improve scalability
- **Health Checks:** I implemented proper health check endpoints that AWS load balancers could use to route traffic only to healthy instances
- **Configuration Management:** I externalized all configuration so services could start up quickly in new instances

The result was our system could handle 10K+ TPS and automatically scale based on demand."

### **3. "How did you ensure security in AWS?"**

**Answer:**
"Security was a shared responsibility between our team and DevOps:

**My responsibilities as a developer:**
- **Application Security:** I implemented proper authentication using Keycloak and JWT tokens
- **Data Encryption:** I ensured sensitive data was encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Input Validation:** I added proper validation to prevent injection attacks
