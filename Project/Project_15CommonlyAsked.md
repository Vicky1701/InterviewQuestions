# MobiLytix Interview Questions - STAR Method Answers

## **Technical Implementation & Problem-Solving**

### 1. **Tell me about the most critical production issue you've encountered. How did you identify the root cause and resolve it?**

**Situation:** During peak hours on a Friday evening, our MobiLytix loyalty platform experienced a complete system outage affecting 100K+ active users. The Wallet Service, which is the backbone of our loyalty system, stopped processing point transactions, causing member reward redemptions to fail across all client applications.

**Task:** As the lead developer for the Member Service and having deep knowledge of the wallet integration, I needed to quickly identify the root cause and restore service while minimizing data loss and ensuring transaction integrity.

**Action:** 
- First, I immediately checked our monitoring dashboard (Prometheus) and found the Wallet Service was throwing database connection timeout errors
- I analyzed the database connection pool metrics and discovered we had a connection leak - connections weren't being properly released after transactions
- I traced the issue to a recent code deployment where a new bulk points calculation feature wasn't properly closing database connections in exception scenarios
- I implemented an immediate hotfix by adding proper connection cleanup in finally blocks and deployed it using our CI/CD pipeline
- I also temporarily increased the database connection pool size to handle the backlog
- Finally, I coordinated with the team to process the queued transactions through our Kafka event stream to ensure no points were lost

**Result:** System was restored within 45 minutes with zero data loss. I prevented approximately $50K in potential revenue loss for our clients. Post-incident, I implemented automated connection pool monitoring and established connection leak detection as part of our code review process, reducing similar issues by 100%.

### 2. **Describe a time when you had to work with microservices architecture. What challenges did you face in service communication?**

**Situation:** When building the MobiLytix platform, we had 11 microservices that needed to communicate seamlessly. The biggest challenge was ensuring data consistency between Member Service, Wallet Service, and Notification Service when users earned or redeemed points.

**Task:** I needed to design a robust service communication strategy that could handle high-volume transactions (10K+ TPS) while maintaining data consistency and system reliability.

**Action:**
- I implemented an event-driven architecture using Apache Kafka for asynchronous communication between services
- For the Member Service, I designed it to publish events when user profiles were updated, which the Wallet Service would consume to update point balances
- I created a distributed transaction pattern using the Saga pattern to handle multi-service transactions like point redemption (involving Member, Wallet, and Notification services)
- I implemented circuit breakers using Spring Cloud to prevent cascade failures when one service was down
- I added correlation IDs to track requests across services and implemented distributed tracing for debugging
- I created health check endpoints for each service and integrated them with our API Gateway for intelligent routing

**Result:** Successfully achieved 99.9% system uptime with the ability to handle 10K+ TPS. The event-driven architecture reduced service coupling by 70% and improved overall system resilience. Transaction processing time improved by 40% compared to synchronous communication.

  - Added database query optimization by creating proper indexes and rewriting N+1 queries
- I redesigned the database schema to denormalize frequently accessed data and created materialized views for complex aggregations
- I implemented connection pooling optimization with HikariCP and tuned the pool size based on concurrent user patterns
- I added asynchronous processing for non-critical operations like audit logging to reduce response times

**Result:** Achieved a 75% improvement in API response times, reducing average response time from 2.3 seconds to 580ms. Database query performance improved by 60%, and the system could now handle 3x more concurrent users without performance degradation. User satisfaction scores increased by 25% due to improved application responsiveness.
